# Rubber Band
A rubber band behavior for Construct 2

This behavior can attach one object to another and exercise a force if these two objects get too far apart.

It can have additional gravity and drag configured to allow for some quite different use cases.

This is still work in progress. Comments, feature requests and suggestions, especially regarding integration into Construct 2, are welcome.

The .c2addon can be build with grunt. Given a working [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installation
```
npm install
grunt build
```
should do the trick.
